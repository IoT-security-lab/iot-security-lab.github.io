The server offers the latest technology available with the best Data-Center GPUs delivering unprecedented acceleration at every scale to power the Data Research Center in the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA).\nSystem Architecture The IoTSec computations system consists of 2 mainly computing servers divided into nodes. A node is an abstraction to represent a virtual system designated for a specific purpose, for example, the login node which is shared among all users.\nSeveral users may be logged on at one time accessing the file systems. Dozens (sometimes hundreds) of jobs may be running on the login node and the resources are shared and equally divided in a first-come-first-server basis. In this way, the login nodes provide an interface to interact with any of the components and is the main point of entry.\nThink of the login node as a prep area, where users may edit and manage files, compile short pieces of code, perform file management, issue transfers, submit and track existing jobs and more. In the other hand, the compute nodes are where actual computations occur and where research is performed. All batch jobs, as well as development and debuggin sessions, must be run on the compute nodes. To access the compute nodes, one must either submit a job to node queue or initate an interactive session using the idev utility.\nDo not run jobs or perform intensive computational activity on the login nodes or the shared file systems. Your account may be suspended if your jobs are impacting other users.
