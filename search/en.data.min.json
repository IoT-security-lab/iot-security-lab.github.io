By default, both options are enable, however, is recommended to use Public Key Authentication. The standard and recommneded method to access is by Secure Shell (SSH). In addition, SSH also includes support for the file transfers utilities scp and sftp. Wikipedia is a good source of information on SSH.\nHowever, you can also access a graphical user interface (GUI) by using the NoMachine app. Keep in mind that GUI sessions requires to start at least 100MB and to run from 100MB to 300MB depending on the applications used. There are many advantages to use NoMachine, specially if you are not familiar with the Linux Bash commands and terminal. Drag and drop of files is enabled to transfer from your local session to the login node. Caution GUI sessions uses x20 times more resources than a non-GUI session. Use it wisely. This is a feature in Beta mode and subject to changes and is not available in the Compute Nodes. If you are using Windows 10 (version 1809 or newer) or 11, the SSH client is included by default using a PowerShell session or the Windows Terminal app.\nBefore you can connect to the server, make sure you are connected to the UTSA Student or Staff Network.\nNote Avoid using the UTSA Guest Wi-Fi since you are not going to be able to connect to the login node. Use the UTSA Student or Staff Wi-Fi.

The server offers the latest technology available with the best Data-Center GPUs delivering unprecedented acceleration at every scale to power the Data Research Center in the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA).\nFile Systems IoT Security lab servers mounts two shared ext4 file systems (FS) on which each user has corresponding node-specific directories $HOME and $WORK. In the login node, both FS are available, however, in the compute nodes, only the work directory is accessable. There is an alias to traverse between the FS, cdw to go to $WORK.\nIn addition, there are directories for storing large datasets under /srv/datasets which are globally accesible with read-only permission. If you need a dataset available, please contact one of hte administrators.\nGood Conduct You share IoTSec servers with many, sometimes hundreds, of others users, and what you do on the system affects others. All users must follow a set of good practices which entail limiting activities that may impact the system for other users. Exercise good conduct to ensure that your activity does not adversely impact the system and the research community with whom you share it.\nAdministrators Get Home "},{"id":4,"href":"/introduction/System-Overview/","title":"System Overview","parent":"Introductions","content":" System Architecture The IoTSec computations system consists of 2 mainly computing servers divided into nodes. A node is an abstraction to represent a virtual system designated for a specific purpose, for example, the login node which is shared among all users.\nSeveral users may be logged on at one time accessing the file systems. Dozens (sometimes hundreds) of jobs may be running on the login node and the resources are shared and equally divided in a first-come-first-server basis. In this way, the login nodes provide an interface to interact with any of the components and is the main point of entry.\nThink of the login node as a prep area, where users may edit and manage files, compile short pieces of code, perform file management, issue transfers, submit and track existing jobs and more.\nDo not run jobs or perform intensive computational activity on the login nodes or the shared file systems. Your account may be suspended if your jobs are impacting other users. In the other hand, the compute nodes are where actual computations occur and where research is performed. All batch jobs, as well as development and debuggin sessions, must be run on the compute nodes. To access the compute nodes, one must either submit a job to node queue or initate an interactive session using the idev utility.\nSystem Specifications Login Node Specification Description vCPU x8 Xeon Gold 5118 RAM 16GB DDR4 2400MHz Storage 1TB HDD Raid 0 Network 1Gbps Interface OS Ubuntu 22.04 Kernel 5.15 Compute Nodes Specification Description vCPU AMD Epyc 7302 3.3GHz 16C/32T RAM 512GB DDR4 3200MHz TPU Nvidia A100 40GB HBM2e PCIe Storage 3.5TB NVMe SSD Network 1Gbps Interface OS Ubuntu 20.04 PSU Redundant 2000 Watts Kernel 5.4 CUDA 11.1 "},{"id":5,"href":"/tags/","title":"Tags","parent":"IoT Security Lab Docs","content":""}]
