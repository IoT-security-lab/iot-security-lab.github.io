The power of this system is in its multiple state-of-the-art GPUs Nvidia A100 40GB. The IoT Security Laboratory servers are available for UTSA students, faculty and affiliated people to the laboratory. Currently, the only way to access them is through the UTSA Networks, either with a direct connection over WiFi or using the VPN. The system software support anaconda, which allows you to use a wide variety of python modules for different data processing frameworks, such a TensorFlow and PyTorch.\nFile Systems IoT Security lab servers mounts two shared ext4 file systems (FS) on which each user has corresponding node-specific directories $HOME and $WORK. In the login node, both FS are available, however, in the compute nodes, only the work directory is accessable. There is an alias to traverse between the FS, cdw to go to $WORK.\nIn addition, there are directories for storing large datasets under /datasets which are globally accesible with read-only permission. If you need a dataset available, please contact one of the administrators.\nGood Conduct You share IoTSec servers with many, sometimes hundreds, of others users, and what you do on the system affects others. All users must follow a set of good practices which entail limiting activities that may impact the system for other users. Exercise good conduct to ensure that your activity does not adversely impact the system and the research community with whom you share it.\nSystem Architecture The IoTSec computations system consists of 2 mainly computing servers divided into nodes. A node is an abstraction to represent a virtual system designated for a specific purpose, for example, the login node which is shared among all users.\nSeveral users may be logged on at one time accessing the file systems. Dozens (sometimes hundreds) of jobs may be running on the login node and the resources are shared and equally divided in a first-come-first-server basis. In this way, the login nodes provide an interface to interact with any of the components and is the main point of entry.\nThink of the login node as a prep area, where users may edit and manage files, compile short pieces of code, perform file management, issue transfers, submit and track existing jobs and more.\nDo not run jobs or perform intensive computational activity on the login nodes or the shared file systems. Your account may be suspended if your jobs are impacting other users. In the other hand, the compute nodes are where actual computations occur and where research is performed. All batch jobs, as well as development and debuggin sessions, must be run on the compute nodes. To access the compute nodes, one must initate an interactive session opening a SSH session by running ssh compute-node.\nSystem Specifications Login Node Specification Description vCPU x8 Xeon Gold 5118 RAM 16GB DDR4 2400MHz Storage 1TB HDD Raid 0 Network 1Gbps Interface OS Ubuntu 22.04 Kernel 5.15 Compute Nodes Specification Description vCPU AMD Epyc 7302 3.3GHz 16C/32T RAM 512GB DDR4 3200MHz TPU Nvidia A100 40GB HBM2e PCIe Storage 3.5TB NVMe SSD Network 1Gbps Interface OS Ubuntu 20.04 PSU Redundant 2000 Watts Kernel 5.4 CUDA 11.1 Administrators You can contact any of the administrator via email.

By default, both options are enable, however, is recommended to use Public Key Authentication. The standard and recommneded method to access is by Secure Shell (SSH). In addition, SSH also includes support for the file transfers utilities scp and sftp. Wikipedia is a good source of information on SSH.\nHowever, you can also access a graphical user interface (GUI) by using the NoMachine app. Keep in mind that GUI sessions requires to start at least 100MB and to run from 100MB to 300MB depending on the applications used. There are many advantages to use NoMachine, specially if you are not familiar with the Linux Bash commands and terminal. Drag and drop of files is enabled to transfer from your local session to the login node. Caution GUI sessions uses x20 times more resources than a non-GUI session. Use it wisely. This is a feature in testing stage and subject to changes. In addition GUI session is not available in the Compute Nodes. If you are using Windows 10 (version 1809 or newer) or 11, the SSH client is included by default using a PowerShell session or the Windows Terminal app.\nConnect to UTSA Network Before you can connect to the server, make sure you are connected to the UTSA Student or Staff Network if you are on campus. However, if you are not located within the UTSA installations, you will need to use the UTSA VPN in order for you to reach the login-node. A good tutorial and information about UTSA VPN is located in this link.\nNote Avoid using the UTSA Guest Wi-Fi since you are not going to be able to reach to the login node. Use the UTSA Student or Staff Wi-Fi. Access the Login-node Login-node IP address: 10.3.12.42 Once you are connected to UTSA Network, you should be able to reach the Login-node (you can test it with the command ping 10.3.12.42).\nTo open a SSH session, you can use the command ssh \u0026lt;username\u0026gt;@10.3.12.42 to login using password authentication replacing the \u0026lt;\u0026gt; with your username. In addition you can use public key authentication by appending -i \u0026lt;relative path to private key\u0026gt; to the previous command.\nIf you want to use a GUI session using NoMachine, verify the NoMachine is installed and running in your local PC. You can download the latest version in this link. Your credentials should correspond to the username and the password provided in addition to the IP of the Login-node. Once you are logged in, you are going to be presented with a XFCE desktop. For more information about XFCE, see this link.\nUse the \u0026ldquo;ssh\u0026rdquo; command to connect to the server. Access SSH from your system\u0026rsquo;s terminal. If you are using Windows, a SSH client that supports the SSH-2 protocol is needed.\nAccess the server with the following login command:\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/basic/FAQ/","title":"FAQ","parent":"Basics","content":""},{"id":3,"href":"/","title":"","parent":"","content":" Welcome Documentation for the IoT Security Laboratory computing servers IoTSec computation server is the primary resource for any computational needs including data analysis, machine learning workloads and high-performance computing for any member or student of the IoTSecurity Laboratory in Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the University of Texas at San Antonio.
